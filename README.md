# Crime Management System
Object oriented programming project

### Notes
I've divided the project into two main packages (The default package and the GUI package)
The classes we implemented are in the default package (we can change that later) and the forms in the GUI package

### GUI Forms
We have login form and access forms and class handeling forms
I know that's too many forms but explicit is better than implicit and in this way every form will do only one thing
to avoid complicity

```LoginForm``` too obvious
```AdminForm``` form that access all the system data
```OfficerForm``` form to access cases and criminals data only

```OfficerManagement``` ```CasesManegement``` ```DepartmentManagement``` ```CriminalManagement```
these four forms manage the data for each class *hopefully cardlayout to handle every add, edit, view
functionality for all of them

hopefully you don't freak out when you read this README file cause we're running short on time here
but I think we can make it

as always happy just before the discussion coding
